"# poli-usp-recicla"

This prototype was created in 2010 while I was working at the University of SÃ£o Paulo.

With more than 90 laboratories, the University used to spend a lot of money mapping wastes (including hazardous ones) and also buying products for some laboratories that existed in excess in other laboratories. This system was meant to allow laboratories to map and exchange chemicals and other products, minimizing wastes.
